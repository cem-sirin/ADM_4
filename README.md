# Homework 4 for Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining, Fall 2022: *Getting to know your customers*
This repository is for submitting the fourth homework of Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining in the name of Group 3.

## Overview of the Project
The goal of this project is to provide the tools searching, querying and analysing the data of a banking company. In the first part, we have implemented the LSH algorithm to find similar customers. Next we have experimented with different dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms to group customers together. Morever, we have given examples on how to use the command line for daily tasks. The project ends with answering algorithmic questions.
